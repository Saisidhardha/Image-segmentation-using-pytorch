# Image-segmentation-using-pytorch

PyTorch, a robust neural network framework, excels in deep learning for image segmentation. This technique categorizes every pixel into predefined classes, vital in medical imaging, autonomous driving, and robotics. Image segmentation comprises semantic (class-based) and object (instance-based) tasks. PyTorch's adaptability makes it ideal for training models like U- Net, widely recognized in medical image segmentation.
1.	PyTorch is a flexible and powerful framework for creating and training neural networks.
2.	Image segmentation is an image analysis procedure in which each pixel in an image is classified into a class.
3.	There are two main types of image segmentation tasks: class (semantic) segmentation and object (instance) segmentation.
